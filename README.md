# RandomUser_iOS_VIPER.MVVM_Swift
A small app (written in Swift) to demonstrate a custom architecture: the blend of the VIPER and the MVVM architecture in the iOS development.

It contains some well-known and well-tested external libraries:
- networking: [Alamofire](https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire), [Moya](https://github.com/Moya/Moya), [Just](https://github.com/dduan/Just)
- dependency injection: [Swinject](https://github.com/Swinject/Swinject)
- images: [Kingfisher](https://github.com/onevcat/Kingfisher), [SDWebImage](https://github.com/SDWebImage/SDWebImage), [Nuke](https://github.com/kean/Nuke), [AlamofireImage](https://github.com/Alamofire/AlamofireImage)
- persistence: [Realm](https://github.com/realm/realm-cocoa)
- transitions: [Hero](https://github.com/HeroTransitions/Hero), [SkeletonView](https://github.com/Juanpe/SkeletonView)
- animations: [Lottie](https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-ios)
- reactive: [RxSwift](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxSwift)

The app is designed with the Separation of Concern (SoC) and SOLID principles. It's made by the use of XCode 11+, Swift 5+, iOS 13+ with .storyboard files (UIKit) and SPM (Swift Package Manager). The main goal is to show a really simple fusion architectural pattern of the VIPER and the MVVM in practice. If you are interested you can take a look at my other repos as well.

The app contains a lot of comments, so it's easy to pick up the thread. If you have any suggestions, please contact me!

Tests and previews will be coming in the near future.
